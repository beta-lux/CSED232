**Object Oriented Programming**, a class of POSTECH, is to enable students to understand concepts related to object-oriented programming. The concepts will be made concrete through programming assignments. In this class we use C++ as the programming language. Topics include classes, class hierarchy and inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, templates and C++  I/O classes. We use Qt as the graphics user interface library for C++. Students are assumed to be very familiar with C programming.
